How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Sharing code between each other sure makes a better job at organizing yourself.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: logical differences. Easier to get to a working version.
Cons: User error. loosing a file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
 allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because files belong together a make sense only in unity.
